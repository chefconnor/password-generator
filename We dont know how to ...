Is this thing on?

Since we don't know how to do this, we should figure out some of the types of things we need to figure out how to do.

User has an opportunity to specify the region of the keyboard.
Unconfined random key is generated
Key is looked up in a dictionary or table
The dictionary or table contains a coordinate pair (b,n)
a list is somehow discerned of coordinate pairs which are +/- a finger's length
n number of entries from that list are generated and displayed

the passwords would need to be longer to account for the reduced randomness of confinement.
